# abcraft
Tis is essentially a rework of 'my' ABC craft music score processor to
use PySide/PyQt4 (currently it is a geanyplug-in)
'abcraft' is a working title; maybe it will become 'abccraft' or
'abcside' - perhaps even 'abcclef (easy to design an icon for that!).

I'm maintaining two prototype versions here:

abcraft-0.1 depends on the use of abcm2ps version 6.6.22.

abcraft-0.2 works with the latest stable acm2ps (version 7.8.14) but not
with the older version. This will be reworked soon to be less fussy 
about specific versions, and hopefully by reasonably future-proof.
